                    Like most modern consoles, the Nintendo Switch has a fairly unremarkable design: 
                    rectangles mixed with a few softer curves, all rendered in matte plastics. You 
                    can choose the Neon color option, whose blue and red Joy-Con controllers give 
                    it a bit more personality, or the plainer all-gray version which gives a more 
                    cohesive look to the console. Either way, the centerpiece of the Switch is a 
                    gray rectangle with the display on it.

            The dock, a rather dull rectangle of black plastic by default, is more interesting than 
            its appearance would indicate. There's a space for the Switch to slide into, which contains 
            a hidden USB Type-C connector, plus a port for the AC adapter to attach. The side and back 
            of the dock contain a total of three USB ports for plugging in accessories and an HDMI 
            output to connect to your monitor or TV, covered by a molded flap that aims to keep your 
            cables tidy. (See our recommendations for the best gaming TVs to find the best match for the Switch)

            Mechanically, however, the Switch is very smart. With the Joy-Cons attached to its side rails, 
            the console behaves like a large handheld. Alternatively, you can slide the Joy-Cons off 
            and use them separately in tabletop mode. When you play this way, you can lay the Switch 
            flat, or prop it up on its built-in stand. Finally, there's TV mode, where the console plugs 
            into the included dock to play your games on a separate display.

        <p>
            This is the only way you're able to play your games at their maximum 1080p resolution 
            (in handheld mode, they default to 720p), but the console's portability is very useful. It's 
            how many other Switch users and I tend to play. Handheld mode is so prevalent that Nintendo's 
            newer Switch Lite cannot dock to a TV at all. The console uses game cards for its physical media, 
            which you insert into a covered port on the top of the system. You'll also find the power button, 
            a 3.5-millimeter jack for attaching headphones or speakers and a volume button on the Switch's top edge.
